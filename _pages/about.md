### About me

I am a first-year PhD student in the [Caltech Rigorous Systems Research Group](http://rsrg.cms.caltech.edu), advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com) and [Prof. Eric Mazumdar](https://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/) at the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) Department](https://www.cms.caltech.edu), [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu). You can find my CV [here](../assets/pdf/cv.pdf). Before joining Caltech, I obtained my B.Sc. degree at Peking University.

### Research interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical foundations for sequential decision-making, robust multi-agent systems, and data-driven optimization for real-world applications.
