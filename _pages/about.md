I am a fourth year undergraduate student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) (PKU), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pengcheng You](https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/). This summer, I worked as a visiting student in the [Caltech Rigorous Systems Research Group](http://rsrg.cms.caltech.edu), advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com) at the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) Department](https://www.cms.caltech.edu), [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu). You can find my CV [here](../assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My research interest include estabilishing theoretical foundations of Reinforcement Learning (RL), designing algorithms for Multi-agent systems and fostering the deployment of Machine Learning tools in the real world.
